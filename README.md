It is a nose and teeth based interaction system, which allows the users to control their smartphone completely hands-free. The system uses the front-facing camera of the smartphone to track the position of the nose for cursor control on the smartphone screen. The system detects teeth for performing the touch screen events such as tap, scroll, long press, and drag. 

Android Studio and OpenCV are used to make this system.
